# adversarial-attacks
Uses [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) to generate adversarial images against Google's Inception v3 model. Code based off [Roman Trusov's repo](https://github.com/Lextal/adv-attacks-pytorch-101).

## Usage

An installation of PyTorch is assumed. Examples can then be generated by running `adversarial.py`. Input images as well as attack types (targeted vs. non-targeted) can be specified within this file. 

```bash
$ python adversarial.py
```
